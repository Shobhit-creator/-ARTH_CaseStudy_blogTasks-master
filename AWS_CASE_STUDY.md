## The Challenge
The energy sector is undergoing far-reaching change. The three Ds — Decentralisation, Decarbonisation and Digitisation — are affecting all areas of business.
The Origin had already gone a long way to meeting consumer demands by giving them digital tools. But as technology made meters, appliances and energy grids smarter, it knew digital interactions would grow exponentially.

Now the Power generation is more decentralized as consumers become producers through solar energy at home. So, if we talk about the Carbon intensive power stations are being phased out. At the same time, digitally empowered consumers not only expect more, they want to control when and how they use energy.

## Data Is the Lynchpin
Much of that success will depend on how Origin supports growing customer self-service. As Jon Briskin, Origin’s Executive General Manager of Retail points out: “The most important thing in a new digital world is actually to make things simple for customers.”
When it was time for a data centre refresh, Origin decided to put its strategy in motion by moving to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.

## Solution
AWS has the longest track record running SAP on the cloud and provides proven partners and tooling to support any SAP strategy. AWS offers a broad portfolio of SAP certified offerings and cutting-edge services that help thousands of customers innovate and derive new value from their SAP investments.
Origin selected a range of AWS services for its SAP retail applications. Since the applications underpin transactions worth millions of dollars, system responsiveness and reliability were vital.
At the core were high performing compute and storage to handle multiple customer interactions via the Origin website and app.

Given the transaction intensive workloads, automatic load balancing to even out traffic flows was also chosen. As was a private AWS network to the cloud for high speed data throughput.
Because the SAP platform contained sensitive financial and personal data, security was paramount. Origin adopted AWS cloud security to protect its accounts and workloads, which it controls from one place.

## The Benefits
Moving the SAP platform to the AWS cloud has already delivered significant advantages. Crucially for a company that strives to put customers first, the cloud’s power is making customer self-service easier and more rewarding.

Responsiveness to customers has also improved. Self-service has reduced the load on the call centre, while a 10 percent performance boost in the CRM module offers speedier access to information. Staff are now more productive and have more time to engage in richer customer conversations.
With data critical to operations, the ability to process it faster has also been welcomed. In fact, Origin reports at least a 30 percent improvement in batch run time for billing. Speed is matched by greater agility. Origin can now gear up compute resources to easily handle peaks in demand so customers aren’t kept waiting. And just as easily gear them down.

## Why AWS

When looking for a cloud provider, Origin obviously factored in quality and scale of infrastructure, as well as the scope of services offered. However, three attributes made AWS the standout candidate.
Firstly, AWS’ attitude earned praise. AWS took time to understand Origin’s business drivers, then focused on solving problems. Moreover, it pointed Origin to other companies with the same issues to gain further insight.

Expertise was another incentive. AWS Professional Services not only brought a depth and breadth of knowledge, they provided access to the skills of a specialist partner network.

## The Future
Fresh from the success of the SAP migration, Origin is now preparing to move its ERP functions of finance, supply chain, procurement and asset management to the AWS cloud with SAP S/4HANA. It expects to gain similar performance, agility and cost-efficiency advantages when it does so.
