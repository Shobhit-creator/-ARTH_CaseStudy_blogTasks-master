# Ansible Case Study

## What is Ansible
Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. It runs on many Unix-like systems and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

## Why to use Ansible
Ansible is easy to learn, it is agentless, it automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

## Companies using Ansible

### British Army
The British Army relies on IT to support its personnel deployed around the world. Its Information Application Services (IAS) Branch delivers software applications, hosting, and web services to the British Army. To overcome issues with unplanned downtime and support, IAS migrated its private cloud environment from Oracle to Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®. With simplified, automated management through Red Hat Ansible Tower®, IAS can deploy changes faster and more efficiently. In addition, the new environment has reduced manual and other errors and eliminated unplanned downtime, helping improve the end-user experience.

### Microsoft
Microsoft Corporation develops, manufactures, and supports software, consumer electronics and computers, and related services. To simplify and scale at pace with market demands, Microsoft worked with Red Hat to create a scalable, technology-agnostic automation framework to reduce manual workloads with efficient tools and processes and mitigate performance and security issues with standardized, tested code. As a result, Microsoft has standardized network automation at scale, established a collaborative and creative development mindset, and saved thousands of hours of operational work.

Using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and working with Red Hat Consulting, Microsoft created a standardized, centralized network automation environment that reduces routine, repeatable tasks and complexity. “Digital transformation is really changing the way that we think about how we solve problems,” said Dworak. “In the past, we had to manually do the same deployment again and again. With Ansible, we can create blueprints to deploy it multiple times. And every time we deploy, it’s exactly the same.”

### NASA
INCREASING CLOUD EFFICIENCY WITH ANSIBLE AND ANSIBLE TOWER.

As a result of implementing the Ansible Tower, NASA is better equipped to manage its AWS environment. Tower allowed NASA to provide better operations and security to its clients. It has also increased efficiency as a team. By the numbers:

* Updating nasa.gov went from over 1 hour to under 5 minutes
* Patching updates went from a multi-day process to 45 minutes
* Achieving near real-time RAM and disk monitoring (accomplished without agents)
* Provisioning OS Accounts across the entire environment in under 10 minutes
* Baselining standard AMIs went from 1 hour of manual configuration to becoming an invisible and seamless background process
* Application stack set up from 1–2 hours to under 10 minutes per stack.

### NetApp
NetApp, a data management technology company, sought to improve the speed and efficiency of its IT service delivery. The company automated manual, repetitive management processes, and streamlined storage provisioning using Red Hat Ansible Automation and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As a result, NetApp has dramatically reduced delays and human errors — eliminating hundreds of hours of manual work — and accelerated application delivery times from weeks to minutes
As an active open source participant and a long-time user of Red Hat software, NetApp decided to pilot Red Hat Ansible Engine, part of Red Hat Ansible Automation, in its NTP update project to eliminate repetitive manual tasks in configuration management. Ansible Engine is an agentless automation platform based on a powerful yet human-readable language that communicates with existing systems, applications, and tools. NetApp’s corporate IT team has used Ansible Engine to automate dozens of previously manual processes and continue to streamline its processes.

### NXP
NXP Semiconductors N.V., one of the world’s largest producers of electronic components, needed to handle increasing product design complexity and growing quality requirements. It required greater compute power to support simulations and testing completed by its 10,000 design engineers. With an efficient IT environment based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, supported by Red Hat Satellite and Red Hat Ansible Automation for automated provisioning and configuration, the company has reduced provisioning time, improved quality through standardization, and simplified management. As a result, it can deliver high-quality components to market faster.
After evaluating potential solutions, NXP decided to deploy Red Hat software to establish this agile, scalable IT environment. The company built its design environment on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, running on HPE hardware, with configuration and automation provided by Red Hat Satellite and Red Hat Ansible Automation. Red Hat Satellite is used to provision new servers and push applications to specific nodes. Red Hat Ansible Automation, including Ansible Tower, manages the configuration of 9,000 nodes, as well as managing storage for NetApp, servers, and other physical infrastructure.
