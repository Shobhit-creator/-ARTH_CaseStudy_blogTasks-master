# Openshift Case Study

## Porsche Informatik speeds development with Red Hat OpenShift

Porsche Informatik, IT service provider for the Volkswagen Automotive Group, needed to speed application development and delivery to stay competitive in a fast-paced global market. The organization used Red Hat OpenShift to create a private cloud container environment. Porsche Informatik’s developers can now take advantage of self-service capabilities, and teams across the organization can work together more effectively with a DevOps approach supporting continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) workflows. As a result, Porsche Informatik has cut development time from weeks to hours and created a solid foundation to stay ahead of competition.

### Benefits
* Reduced development times from 5-6 weeks to hours with self-service provisioning
* Established DevOps community for more engaged teamwork
* Gained support for early adoption of Kubernetes and container technology to outpace competition


## Speeding application development as automotive industry shifts to digital
Porsche Informatik provides IT services to the Volkswagen Automotive Group. Millions of users at car dealerships, workshops, importers, logistics companies, and financial service providers depend on its systems. The organization provides and manages 160 solutions available in 30 countries.

To help shape the digital future of the automotive industry, Porsche Informatik is focused on becoming agile by design to rapidly create and deploy new, digital applications. This goal not only involves a cultural shift to more iterative, agile development, but also replacement of the organization’s legacy IT infrastructure and management solutions.

“Time to market is critical,” said Michael Hinterland, Team Lead, ICS Cloud & Automation and ICS System and Middleware, Porsche Informatik. “In this industry, you’re either first to market, or the first loser. We want to migrate our legacy infrastructure to a platform that can help us build cloud-native applications quickly.”
