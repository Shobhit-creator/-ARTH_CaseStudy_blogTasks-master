# Industry Usecases on NN(Neural Network)

## What is Neural Network?
A Neural Network is the network of neurons(smallest unit). This neural network comes from the biological term.

### **History of Neural Network**
After this, the question arises who made/invented this Neural Network concept.
The history 
of artificial neural networks (ANN) began with Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) who created a computational model for neural networks based on algorithms called threshold logic. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_neural_networks#:~:text=The%20history%20of%20artificial%20neural,on%20algorithms%20called%20threshold%20logic.)

**Geoffrey Hinton** is known as the father of Deep Learning. Geoffrey Everest Hinton CC FRS FRSC[11] (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. Since 2013 he divides his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto. In 2017, he co-founded and became the Chief Scientific Advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto

## Type of Neural Network
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
* Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## The architecture of Neural Network
The Neural Network consists of Three terms input layer, hidden layer, and Output. You can add more hidden layers for better output but itâ€™ll take more resources to get the accurate output.

## Applications of Neural Network
* Speech Recognition
* Character Recognition
* Signature Verification.
* Human face Recognition.
* and much more.

## How companies using Neural Network.
Mmm ðŸ˜…, let takes the examples of e-commerce. there is one company based on e-commerce, so they are using the NN concept to show the recommended products for the user, look we know our choice but by using data we can show only those products to the user which are they most like.

Letâ€™s take one example, let suppose there is one company based on IT Security, So by using the NN concept they can train one model for the detection of virus and malware, or they can also create one model for cyberattacks, and even though by using some more automation tools at the same time they can fix the problems.

Like this is tons of examplesâ€¦â€¦
