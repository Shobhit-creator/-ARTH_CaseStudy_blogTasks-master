## Jenkins Case Study: Topdanmark


### Summary: 
Topdanmark, a leading Danish insurer chooses Jenkins as the “de facto” product to build their CI/CD platform.

### Challenge:
 Balancing the needs of DevOps modernization and cloud migration while maintaining legacy systems.

### Solution: 
A highly-configurable CI/CD platform which allows for automation and ease of development.

### Results:
* 100% automatic creation of Jenkins instances
* the ability to release and deploy an artifact whenever, wherever
* software developers focused on developing software rather than operations
* smaller monoliths and containerization

Innovative technology is key for Topdanmark, a Danish insurance company offering a customer service platform that allows clients to easily and quickly manage their insurance, investments and pensions. These tools are developed internally, using artificial intelligence (AI) to create smart data models, sophisticated speech recognition technologies and a highly responsive chatbot to deliver excellent customer experiences — all propelled by a  reliable, robust infrastructure.
Like many enterprise organizations today, modernization is imperative, especially for those burdened with legacy systems. Topdanmark is no different and is undergoing an extensive transformation, moving from relying on 100% homegrown software to utilizing externally developed “standard” software. So, Topdanmark’s DevTools engineers seized this opportunity to automate their continuous integration delivery platform and take advantage of the cloud. 
“We used Jenkins because almost everyone knows what Jenkins is and how to use it,” said DevTools engineer Jon Brohauge. “It is the ‘de facto’ product to use in our world. And it’s extremely configurable.”
